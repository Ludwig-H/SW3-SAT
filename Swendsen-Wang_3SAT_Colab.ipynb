    "# Higher-Order Swendsen-Wang Dynamics for 3-SAT (Triangle + Tetrahedron)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements a cutting-edge **Cluster Monte Carlo** algorithm for solving 3-SAT problems, bridging Statistical Physics and Combinatorial Optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Physics Model\n",
    "We map the 3-SAT problem onto a **Spatially Embedded Spin System** with higher-order interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Variables & Geometry\n",
    "Consider $N$ variables $\\sigma_i \\in \\{-1, +1\\}$. We augment the graph with a \"Ghost Node\" $\\sigma_0 = +1$ (representing TRUE).\n",
    "Each 3-SAT clause $C_m = (l_1 \\lor l_2 \\lor l_3)$ is encoded by two geometric structures:\n",
    "1.  **A Triangle ($\\mathcal{T}$)**: Connecting the 3 variables involved in the clause.\n",
    "2.  **A Tetrahedron ($\\mathcal{K}$)**: Connecting the Triangle to the Ghost Node $\\sigma_0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Interactions & Colors\n",
    "The edges are colored (signed) to encode the literals:\n",
    "*   **Triangle Edges**: An edge $(i, j)$ is **Antiferromagnetic** (Red, $J=-1$) if literals $l_i, l_j$ have the **same sign**. It is **Ferromagnetic** (Blue, $J=+1$) if they have **opposite signs**. This makes the triangle *Inherently Contradictory* (Frustrated).\n",
    "*   **Tetrahedron Edges**: An edge $(0, i)$ connecting to the Ghost is Ferromagnetic if $l_i$ is positive ($x_i$), and Antiferromagnetic if $l_i$ is negative ($\\neg x_i$).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Dynamics & Weights\n",
    "We introduce a coupling parameter $\\omega$ (playing the role of inverse temperature/interaction strength).\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Tetrahedron (Weight $\\omega$)**: If the clause is SATISFIED (at least one literal matches $\\sigma_0$), we freeze the edges $(0, i)$ with probability $1 - e^{-\\omega}$.\n",
    "*   **Triangle (Weight $\\omega/2$)**: The triangle is an *isotropic inherently contradictory* loop. It fluctuates between two energy levels:\n",
    "    *   **Low Energy ($E_0 = \\omega/2$)**: 1 unsatisfied edge (Frustration limit).\n",
    "    *   **High Energy ($E_1 = 3\\omega/2$)**: 3 unsatisfied edges.\n",
    "    *   **Dynamics**: We follow the *SODA 2026 / Asilomar 2025* prescription (Table 3.1) to freeze specific subsets of edges based on the configuration state.\n",
